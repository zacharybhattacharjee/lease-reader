# Plan: the lease-reading engine

Status: draft for Zachary to review. Nothing in this plan is built. The questions are at the end.

Version 3 (10/26). This version uses the second workbook (with the Asks sheet), the updated `RESEARCH-BRIEF.md`, and your answers to my questions. Your answers replace any earlier ones and are recorded in "Decisions" below.

## What the engine does

Today the page finds 3 clauses by copying their first and last words from the standard form. The engine reads the whole lease instead, and sorts every section into the library you build in the workbook.

For each section of an uploaded lease, it does seven things in order:

1. **Reads** the text from the PDF, and remembers where each line sits on the page.
2. **Splits** the lease into sections, using the section numbers and headings. Riders, exhibits and amendments count as part of the lease.
3. **Sorts** each section into a clause type by matching its trigger phrases.
4. **Finds every version** of that clause the section matches. It never stops at the first match, because a clause can start friendly and then take it back with "provided, however".
5. **Leads each flag to an ask:** the ask, the words to propose, a real lease with the better wording, and a fallback.
6. **Fills in numbers** from the lease, but only where it's sure (stage 2).
7. **Flags** warning phrases, defines glossary phrases, links defined terms, and checks for missing protections (stage 3).

The engine never writes a sentence. It only chooses sentences from the library, and in stage 2 puts the lease's own numbers into the blanks in braces, such as `{days}`. Square brackets, such as `[ten (10)]`, are suggestions for the owner. The engine never fills them.

## Decisions (your answers, 10/26)

1. **Approval.** You approve every row. A row goes live only when its status is "Approved". There is no other reviewer.
2. **Tiers replace the old ranks and risk levels:**
   - A version's tier overrides its clause type's tier.
   - The page lists tier 1 first, then tier 2, then tier 3, in the lease's own order within each tier.
   - You set every tier, including for 6B, 13 and 19. Until you do, the page shows "Tier not set".
   - Ask you before changing how Version 3 shows tiers.
3. **The workbook goes in the repository.** The dataset text stays in its own file, `dataset-red-flags.xlsx`, which never goes in it. (One problem with this: see "What I checked".)
4. **The research dataset** is downloaded into `.test-data/leivaditi-2020/` (details below).
5. **Preview link.** `?preview=1` shows drafts, and every draft line is marked "Draft". The link without `?preview=1` never shows a draft.
6. **Single-word triggers count only in headings,** except these 12, which count anywhere: indemnify, indemnification, subordinate, subordination, holdover, relocate, relocation, recapture, estoppel, guaranty, guarantor, condemnation. Leases without headings are still sorted by their multi-word phrases.
7. **Missing clauses** use the sentences on the Missing clauses sheet. Each one is followed by the shared line, stored once in `content.json`.
8. **Asks** follow the flag-to-ask chain in the brief, from the Asks sheet and the "Ask for instead" column. Square brackets are never filled.
9. **Test leases:**
   - I build the rules from the standard form, the EDGAR leases in the workbook, and about two-thirds of the dataset's 36 labeled U.S. leases.
   - The other third, and the Egleston lease, are held back for fair scores.
   - I never see the Egleston lease. You run it yourself.
10. **First batch:** the 13 clause types that already have versions in the workbook (see "Stage 1").
11. **No separate ranks.** Tiers replace them, and you set them.

## The rules

From your engine request and from `RESEARCH-BRIEF.md`:

- **Everything runs in the owner's browser.** No AI, no outside services, nothing paid. It keeps working on GitHub Pages. The lease never leaves the computer.
- **Every sentence comes from the library or from `content.json`.** The page never writes its own.
- **The library sits apart from the code.** The workbook is its source.
- **The lease's own words sit next to every explanation.**
- **Filled-in numbers are traceable.** The sentence a number came from is highlighted in the lease text.
- **Never guess:**
  - A section that matches no type is "not sorted", shown with its glossary meanings.
  - A section that matches two types shows both, and says the tool is unsure.
- **Riders:** if a rider and a main clause match the same type, both show, with a line saying the rider may change the main clause.
- **Warning phrases match by their complete wording,** with a check for "not" nearby.
- **No scanned pages.** If a PDF has no selectable text, the page tells the owner to use one where the text can be selected.
- **Tiers measure consequence only.** Negotiability is shown separately, through the asks.
- **Above any legal wording,** the page shows the one line from the brief, stored once in `content.json`.
- **The page never says a clause is void.** At most: "Massachusetts law may limit this clause. Ask a lawyer."
- **Some things never go in the repository:**
  - text from Practical Law, Westlaw, Lexis or MCLE
  - the Egleston lease, or any text from it
  - the research dataset
- **Never invent a real example.** Each one is copied from a real lease and names its source.
- **No points, streaks, timers, lease scores, or quizzes on the owner's own lease.**
- **Page wording in `content.json` still goes through `DRAFT-WORDING.md` first,** as `CLAUDE.md` says. Library rows don't, because the workbook's status column does that job.

## The library: from workbook to page

1. **You edit `clause-library.xlsx`** and set each row's status.
2. **The converter** (`tools/convert-workbook.py`) reads the workbook and writes the library files. It uses only what's already on a Mac, so nothing gets installed. I run it whenever you send a new workbook, or you can run it with one command.
3. **The converter lists problems instead of guessing,** for example:
   - a blank in braces that no cue phrase can fill
   - an "Ask for" or "Fallback" that names a version that doesn't exist
   - an answer-key row naming an unknown type
   - two rows with the same ID
4. **The page reads only the library files.** Change the workbook, run the converter, and the page changes with no code change.

**What reaches the page:** approved rows only. With `?preview=1`, draft rows show too, each marked "Draft", and blank tiers show "Tier not set".

| Sheet | Library file |
| --- | --- |
| Clause types | `library/clause-types.json` (replaces today's `clause-types.json`) |
| Versions | `library/versions.json`, including each real example and its source, for the "proof" step |
| Warning phrases | `library/warnings.json`, including "Ask for instead" |
| Asks | `library/asks.json` |
| Glossary | `library/glossary.json` |
| Missing clauses | `library/missing.json` |
| Answer key | read by the test tool (stage 4) |
| How to use, Sources, EDGAR leases found | not turned into files. Reference only. |

The code files: `engine.js` (the engine), `app.js` (draws the page, as today), `test.html` and `test.js` (the test tool), and `tools/convert-workbook.py` (the converter). The workbook and the brief go in the repository when stage 1 starts.

## From flag to ask

This is the chain from the brief, built from the Asks sheet:

1. **The flag.** A section matches a risky version, or contains a risky warning phrase.
2. **What it means.** The page shows the version's plain-language sentence and tier, next to the lease's own words.
3. **The ask:**
   - First, the plain-language ask.
   - Then the shared line from `content.json`.
   - Then "Words to propose", the legal wording, with its square-bracket blanks left as they are.
4. **Proof.** If the ask names a better version, the page shows that version's real example and source, so the owner sees the better wording exists in a real lease.
5. **If they say no.** If there's a fallback version, the page shows it as "If they say no, ask for this instead."

**A risky warning phrase with no version match** uses its "Ask for instead" column.

**Example:** an unlimited personal guaranty shows:
- the guaranty-unlimited sentence, and its tier (or "Tier not set")
- the ask to cap it
- the proposed cap wording
- the capped guaranty from the Sensus Drug Development filing as proof
- the burn-off version as the fallback

**Where this gets built:**
- Version flags, asks, proof and fallbacks come in **stage 1**, since versions are matched then.
- Warning-phrase swaps come in **stage 3**, with the warning phrases.
- How the chain looks on the page is your call (question 4).

## What I checked in your files

### Fixed since the last workbook

- **Darryl** is gone from the approval steps.
- **Missing-clause sentences** now say "The tool didn't find…", with a shared follow-up line.
- **The dataset sheet** is out of the workbook.

### Still open from last time

- **Broken links.** 4 EDGAR links still end in `.txt/seq-2` or `.txt/seq-6` and don't open: ON Technology, Sensus Drug Development, WatchGuard and Boston Restaurant Associates. Sensus is now a "proof" example, so its link matters more.
- **Blanks the engine can't fill yet.** Only 2 versions have a `{days}` blank inside a cue phrase. The other 13 versions with blanks show their sentence without the number until I draft matching cue phrases in stage 2, for you to check.
- **A number mismatch.** `opex-base-year` lists `share` as a number to fill, but its sentence has no `{share}`.
- **Three warning phrases still misfire as written:**
  - "as is" also matches "such portion as is necessary".
  - "waiver" (under "hereby waives") also matches "waiver of subrogation".
  - "sole discretion" can be the tenant's discretion, which is friendly.
  
  I'll add matching rules for these. You don't need to change the workbook.

### New problems

- **Dataset text is still in the workbook.** 15 "real example" cells on the Versions sheet are quotes from the research dataset, for example `utilities-no-liability` and `surrender-wear-and-tear`. If the workbook and `versions.json` go in the repository, those quotes go with them. Some are "proof" examples, so they'd also show on the public page (question 1).
- **Proof from big companies.** Most proof examples are leases of large public companies. An owner might read "other leases do this" as "I can get this too". The page may need one line saying so (question 2).
- **"Ask for instead" mixes two kinds of text.** Some cells are legal wording ("not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed"). Others are plain asks ("Ask to remove the waiver."). The page needs to know which is which, to put legal wording under the shared line (question 3).
- **Two wordings for one ask.** The `transfer-tenant-stays-liable` ask releases you "from all obligations arising after the date of the assignment". The "remain primarily liable" swap releases you with no date limit, which is broader. They should probably match.
- **Legal wording to check.** You said this is the part to check most carefully. What I noticed:
  - **opex-full-share** proposes paying increases over "the Base Year". A lease with a full-share clause may not define a Base Year at all, so the wording may need a blank, such as "the calendar year [2027] (the "Base Year")".
  - **termination-on-notice** asks for "the unamortized cost of Tenant's improvements" without saying over what period. Landlord and owner could read that differently. A blank such as "[amortized evenly over the initial Term]" would settle it.
  - **opex-includes-capital** asks to leave out all capital costs. The GBREB form itself allows only capital costs that reduce other operating costs or are required by law, spread over years with interest. That could make a realistic fallback.
  - **opex-estimates-only** refers to "the estimate in this Lease", but some leases give the estimate in a separate letter, or not at all.
  - **deposit-top-up**'s wording is a fragment ("within [thirty (30)] days after written demand") rather than a full sentence. That's fine if the page labels it as replacement words for the deadline.
  - **Square-bracket style varies:** "[180]" in one place, "[ten (10)]" in others.
- **A column no longer used.** The Clause types sheet still has an empty "What to ask for (Q3)" column. Since the Asks sheet replaces it, the converter will ignore it unless you say otherwise.
- **Middle versions have no asks.** Every "Worst" version has an ask. "Middle" versions, such as `transfer-profit-sharing` and `repairs-landlord-self-help`, don't. The brief's chain starts from "a risky version", so I'll treat only "Worst" versions and risky warning phrases as flags unless you say otherwise (question 5).

## The research dataset

- **Where it is:** `.test-data/leivaditi-2020/` in the project folder. I added `.test-data/` to `.gitignore`, and to your computer's local git settings, so it can't be committed by accident, even before this branch is merged.
- **What it is:** 179 leases with annotations, from the record at DOI 10.21942/uva.19732993.v1. I downloaded only `annotated_dataset.zip` and the label legend, not `ALeaseBert.zip`.
- **License:** the record's description says CC BY-NC 4.0, as your brief says. Its license field says "Restrictive license", but the description gives the terms. Credit the authors wherever results appear.
- **The leases are web pages, not PDFs.** Testing on them skips the PDF-reading step. It does test the splitter's "heading inside the paragraph" rules, which the standard form can't.
- **The 36 U.S. leases:** a quick count finds 39 annotated leases with Landlord and Tenant wording and section labels. Some may be British. In stage 1, I'll pick the 36, list them for you, and split them about two-thirds for building and one-third held back. I'll write that split down before I look at any of the held-back leases.

## How sorting decides

- **Trigger phrases:**
  - Multi-word trigger phrases count anywhere in a section.
  - Single words count only in the section's heading, except the 12 words in decision 6.
  - A section is sorted into a type when it matches enough phrases, and clearly more than any other type.
- **Two types both match well:** "unsure", and both show.
- **Nothing matches well enough:** "not sorted".
- **Versions:** every version's cue phrases are checked against the whole section, and every version that matches shows. Cue phrases with "…", such as "Landlord may … terminate this Lease", allow a few words in between.
- **Lettered parts with their own heading** (6A, 6B) are sorted on their own. Lettered items inside one sentence, such as 19 (a), (b) and (c), stay with their section.
- **Riders:** if a rider matches the same type as a main clause, or names it ("Section 13"), both show, with the "may change" line. The engine never decides which one governs.
- **Defined terms:** capitalized terms like "Additional Rent" link to where the lease defines them, when the engine can find the definition. If it can't, there's no link, and nothing is guessed.
- **The first test run is recorded before anyone changes the "enough" and "clearly more" settings.**

## Numbers the engine reads (stage 2)

In every case, if the engine isn't sure, it shows the sentence without the number and points to the lease's own words.

- **Words and digits together,** such as "ten (10) days". They must agree, or nothing is filled in.
- **Business days.** "Ten (10) Business Days" fills `{days}` with "10 business", so the sentence reads "10 business days".
- **Dollars,** such as "$3,000.00" and "Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00)".
- **Percentages,** such as "five percent (5%)" and "5% per annum".
- **Choices** ("whichever is greater", "the lesser of"):
  - Both numbers show.
  - The engine says which applies only when it can tell from the numbers themselves. Otherwise it says the lease decides, using a library sentence.
- **Index-based amounts** ("increase by the CPI") have no number to fill. A library sentence says the amount depends on inflation.
- **Dates and years,** such as "Base Year", "Commencement Date" and "2027".
- **Empty blanks,** as in your copy of the standard form. The page uses a "the lease leaves this blank" sentence from the library. That needs a new row or column in the workbook (question 8).

## The stages

I stop after each stage so you can check it.

### Stage 1: Read, split, sort, versions and asks

- **What I build:**
  - The workbook and brief go in the repository.
  - The converter.
  - The engine's read, split, sort and version steps.
  - The flag-to-ask chain for versions.
  - Preview mode.
  - Tier order.
  - The dataset split, written down.
  - The page shows sorted, unsure and not-sorted sections. How they look is your call (question 4).
- **Scope:** all 32 clause types are sorted by their triggers. The 13 types with versions get versions and asks:
  - default
  - personal guaranty
  - operating costs
  - assignment and subletting
  - relocation
  - landlord termination
  - security deposit
  - utilities
  - surrender
  - repairs
  - casualty
  - subordination
  - tenant termination
- **Is 13 too many?** No.
  - The code works the same for 1 type or 32. The size of a batch mostly changes how much you have to check.
  - **9 of the 13 are in the standard form,** so you can check them in one upload: 6B, 13, 19, 5, 11, 7, 21, 18 and 14.
  - **The other 4 aren't:** personal guaranty, relocation, landlord termination and tenant termination. I check those on the EDGAR and dataset leases and show you the results.
  - **If you'd rather cut,** cut those 4 from the first check, not from the library. That's based only on what's easy to test, not on how serious they are.
- **Compared with my earlier nine:**

  | | Clause types |
  | --- | --- |
  | In both lists | security deposit, repairs (I called it maintenance), casualty, surrender |
  | Mine, not yours | alterations, indemnification, liability insurance and late charge. The workbook has types for these, but no versions yet, so they wait. Also liability of owner (GBREB 26). |
  | Yours, not mine | default, operating costs, subletting, guaranty, relocation, both terminations, utilities, subordination |

  **Your list is the better start, because it's the one with versions ready.**

  **Gaps in the workbook:** it has no clause type at all for liability of owner (GBREB 26), force majeure (24), compliance with laws (9), fire insurance (10) or brokerage (22). On the standard form those show as "not sorted". That's honest, but it's worth knowing before the demo.
- **What you look at:**
  - **The standard form with `?preview=1`:** every section is listed as sorted, unsure or not sorted. Each flag has its ask, proof and fallback, and is marked "Draft". The tiers say "Tier not set".
  - **The same link without `?preview=1`:** no drafts show anywhere.
  - **The residential sample:** almost everything is "not sorted", with nothing guessed.
  - **The converter's report:** read its list of workbook problems.
  - **The dataset split:** read the list of leases for building and the ones held back.

### Stage 2: The lease's own numbers

- **What I build:**
  - The number finders above.
  - Highlighting the sentence each number came from (the look is your call).
  - Drafts of the missing cue-phrase blanks, for you to check in the workbook.
- **What you look at:**
  - Every filled-in number matches its highlighted sentence.
  - Square brackets are never filled.
  - "Ten (15) days" fills nothing and says to check the lease.

### Stage 3: Warning phrases, swaps, glossary, defined terms and missing clauses

- **What I build:**
  - **Warning phrases** across the whole lease, with:
    - the "not" check
    - the fixes for "as is", "waiver" and "sole discretion"
    - each risky phrase's "Ask for instead"
  - **Glossary meanings,** using step 9c's tap-a-word feature.
  - **Defined-term links.**
  - **Missing-clause checks** with the shared line.
- **What you look at:**
  - "Shall not be unreasonably withheld" shows as friendly.
  - "Such portion as is necessary" isn't flagged.
  - Glossary words work in "not sorted" sections.
  - Missing-clause messages appear only for types the engine really didn't find.
- **A limit to know:** the "not" check doesn't catch every way of flipping a meaning, such as "except" or "unless".

### Stage 4: The test tool

- **What I build:** `test.html`, not linked from the main page. You choose a lease and its answer key (the Answer key sheet saved as CSV). It reports each section as one of:
  - **correct**
  - **wrong**
  - **unsure**
  - **not sorted**
  - **missed:** the splitter never found it
- **It gives a type score and a version score.** "Unsure" never counts as correct.
- **Reports are saved to your computer,** marked "first run" or "after tuning", with the date, the scores, and a code that changes whenever the library changes. You can compare a new run with an earlier report.
- **It also accepts the dataset's web-page leases,** with an answer key made from the dataset's own section labels, so the held-back third gets a fair score.
- **What you look at:** save the first run before any rule changes. Later, run the Egleston lease yourself.
- **The honest claim:** "it works well on leases like the ones it was built from."

## Not planned: your decisions first

From the brief. I won't build any of these until you choose:

- How Version 3 shows 10 or more cards, and how it shows tiers.
- An ask list the owner builds while reading, kept on their own device.
- Showing what a clause could cost over time.
- A practice game on the sample lease only, saving nothing.
- A scripted negotiation rehearsal. The asks and fallbacks would be its moves.

## What else this changes

- **`CLAUDE.md` needs updating for:**
  - the engine and the workbook as the library's source
  - the converter
  - preview mode, since drafts can now appear on the page, marked "Draft"
  - tiers in place of ranks

  I'll show you the new wording first.
- **Today's 3 clauses and their risk marks** ("1 Highest risk") move to tiers. What the mark says for a tier is new wording (question 6).
- **Step 9:** 9c's tap-a-word feature is reused in stage 3, so building 9c first saves work.
- **Step 8 (whole lease view):** the engine keeps where each line sits, so highlights can later cover every sorted section.

## Questions for you

### Needed before stage 1

1. **The 15 dataset quotes in the Versions sheet.** They'd go in the repository with the workbook, and the proof examples would show on the public page. Pick one:
   - **(a)** Move them to `dataset-red-flags.xlsx`, and use them only for finding phrases. Proof then comes only from EDGAR leases. Suggestion: this one, since it keeps "dataset text stays off" true.
   - **(b)** Keep them, with a credit line on the page and in the repo. CC BY-NC allows that for non-commercial use, but it breaks the rule in your brief.
2. **A line next to proof examples?** For example: "From a real lease filed with the SEC. Larger businesses often get terms that smaller ones don't." It's new wording, so it would go through `DRAFT-WORDING.md` first.
3. **Split "Ask for instead" into two columns,** one for legal wording and one for a plain ask? Otherwise the converter has to guess which is which, and it never guesses.
4. **How the flag-to-ask chain looks in each version,** and how "unsure" and "not sorted" look. You said layout is your call. A rough sketch or a few words is enough.
5. **Which versions count as flags:** "Worst" only, or "Middle" too? Middle versions have no asks yet.
6. **What the tier mark says.** For example "Tier 1: could cost you the space or the business", or "Tier 1" alone. And what do sections with "Tier not set" do in tier order: go last?
7. **A section that matches two versions with different tiers.** Suggestion: it's placed by its most serious tier, and both versions show their own tiers.

### Can wait

8. **"Left blank" sentences** for empty form blanks. Add a column on the Versions sheet, or one shared line in `content.json`?
9. **Should your 23 word meanings from step 9c go into the Glossary sheet,** so there's one glossary?
10. **Test tool timing.** A basic test tool in stage 1 would record sorting before I tune anything. Or keep it all in stage 4?
11. **The two outside files.** The page loads pdf.js from cdnjs and the fonts from Google. They never see the lease. Copy them into the repo so the page uses no outside sites at all?
12. **The sample lease button.** Keep today's 3 sample clauses, or retire it once uploads work well?
13. **The legal-wording notes above** (Base Year, the unamortized period, a capital-cost fallback, the estimate, the bracket style, and the two release wordings). Will you change them in the workbook, or should I list exact suggestions for you to paste?
